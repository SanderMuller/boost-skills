# Changelog

All notable changes to `sandermuller/boost-skills` will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## 0.1.0 - 2026-05-20

First release of `boost-skills` — a package of generic AI agent skills in the `SKILL.md` Agent Skills format, for PHP projects and Composer packages. Skills are authored once here and distributed to every configured AI agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Codex, Gemini, and the rest) by `boost-core`. Install `boost-skills` alongside a boost family package; see the README for setup.

### Skills

15 skills ship under `resources/boost/skills/`:

- **Review** — `code-review`, `codex-review`, `pr-review-feedback`, `evaluate`
- **Specs** — `write-spec`, `implement-spec`
- **Quality gates** — `backend-quality`, `frontend-quality`, `pre-release`
- **Debugging & performance** — `bug-fixing`, `autoresearch`
- **Jira workflow** — `jira-create`, `jira-rework`, `jira-updates`
- **AI configuration** — `ai-guidelines`

### Skill tags

Seven skills declare `boost-tags` — capability tags (`php`, `frontend`, `github`, `jira`) that mark which projects a skill is relevant to. A `boost-core` version with tag filtering syncs a tagged skill only to projects that opt into the matching capability; with earlier versions the tags are inert and every skill syncs. The remaining eight skills are universal.
