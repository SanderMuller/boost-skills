## AskUserQuestion Phrasing

When writing an `AskUserQuestion` question, option labels, or option descriptions, **avoid first- and second-person pronouns** — `I`, `me`, `my`, `we`, `our`, `you`, `your`. In that tool the user is reading a question *from* the assistant and answering it, so the roles are inverted and these pronouns are ambiguous: the reader cannot tell whether `I`/`my` means the assistant or themselves, nor whether `you`/`your` means them or the assistant.

Name the actor explicitly instead — "the assistant" (these guidelines are shared across agents, so avoid hard-coding a product name like Claude or Copilot) and "the user" (or a concrete role) for the person answering — or rephrase to drop the pronoun entirely.

```text
❌ "Which approach do you want me to take?"
❌ "Should I keep the existing tests you wrote?"

✅ "Which approach should the assistant take?"
✅ "Keep the existing tests, or replace them?"   (pronoun dropped)
✅ "Should the assistant keep the tests already in the repo?"
```

This applies to every part of the question payload: the `question` text, each option `label`, and each option `description`.
