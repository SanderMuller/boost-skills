## Fixing PHPStan Errors

When fixing a PHPStan error, first decide whether it represents a runtime bug a test could catch — and if so, write that test before the fix.

### Process

1. **Assess testability** — does the error represent a runtime bug a test could reproduce (a wrong argument type, a missing method, an incorrect return type used downstream)?
2. **Write the test first** — if a test can catch it, write a failing test that reproduces the error before applying the fix.
3. **Fix the code** — apply the fix so both the PHPStan error and the new test pass.
4. **Verify both** — confirm PHPStan reports no error and the test passes.

### When to Write a Test

Write a test when the PHPStan error indicates a fault that would surface at runtime:

- A method call on a value of the wrong type
- Missing or incorrect arguments to a function or method
- A return-type mismatch that would break callers
- Accessing a property or method that does not exist
- Any type error that would manifest as a runtime exception

### Annotate Rather Than Suppress

Some errors are PHPStan reading a signature that says less than the code does. When a parameter decides the return type, add a conditional `@return ($param is Type ? A : B)`. When a bool method is a pure type check, add `@phpstan-assert-if-true`. Add either one only where it holds for every call; a wrong one makes the analysis worse. The `backend-quality` skill, where the project ships it, has the full rules and examples.

### When to Skip the Test

Skip the test when the error is purely static and cannot cause a runtime failure:

- Missing return-type declarations
- PHPDoc mismatches with no runtime impact
- Unused variables or imports
- Generic-type parameter issues
